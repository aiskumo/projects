Hi there! I'm Aiswarya. I graduated in December 2020 from Carnegie Mellon with a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I plan to leverage my coursework and professional skills in my upcoming endeavors. I'm seeking full-time opportunities in SWE/SDE/AI/ML roles, and I enjoy working on automatic speech recognition/deep learning/machine learning/natural language processing problems. 


Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact me! You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinodku/).

[I possess a hearing disability and use a cochlear implant and spoken English to communicate, so I often use video calls/emails/text communication in lieu of phone calls.]
