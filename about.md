Hi there! I'm Aiswarya. I recently graduated in Dec 2020 from Carnegie Mellon with a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and plan to leverage my coursework and professional skills in my upcoming endeavors. I'm seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML/voice computing (CS/ECE) starting in January 2021. 

I possess a hearing disability and use a cochlear implant and spoken English to communicate.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to email me! You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinodku/).
